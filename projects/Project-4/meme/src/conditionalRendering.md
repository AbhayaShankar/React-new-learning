1. What is "conditional rendering"?
   Conditional rendering is the method we can use to decide what to render or display on screen if the condition is met.

2. When would you use &&?
   We use && when we want to display an item if the condition is truthy or else we dont want to display that at all

3. When would you use a ternary?
   We use Ternary when we want to display something if condiiton is true or another thing when the condiitioan is false.

4. What if you need to decide between > 2 options on
   what to display?

We can declare if else condition or use nested conditional rendering.
Althouugh a it is better not to use nested rendering
